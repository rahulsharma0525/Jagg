            <p>A <code>PercentileAggregator</code> is an Aggregator that determines and returns the
            <em>x</em>th percentile of the numeric property values.  The percentile value is a
            decimal number from 0.0 to 1.0, and it must be a constant number.  If no values were
            encountered, then the percentile value is <code>NaN</code>.  If the percentile value
            does not fall directly on one particular value, then linear interpolation is used to
            determine the percentile value.  This means that it is possible for the percentile
            value not to come from the list of all values.  This Aggregator overrides the
            <code>terminateDoubleDouble</code> method, so that the percentile value is also
            available as a <a href="../dd/double_double.html">DoubleDouble</a>.  This allows the
            percentile value to be used by other Aggregators as a high-precision
           <code>DoubleDouble</code>.</p>

        <section id="usage" name="Usage">
            <p>Create and use a <code>PercentileAggregator</code>, with one of the following methods:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>Aggregator agg = new PercentileAggregator(percentile, "property");</code></li>
                <li><code>Aggregator agg = new PercentileAggregator(0.5, "property");</code></li>
                <li><code>Aggregator agg = Aggregator.getAggregator("Percentile(0.75, property)");</code></li>
                <li><code>Aggregator agg = Aggregator.getAggregator("Percentile(" + percentile + ", property)");</code></li>
            </ul>
            <p>The values returned by the property of the object must be numeric.</p>
            <p>If the given percentile maps directly to one particular value, then that value is
            used.  Else, if the percentile maps somewhere in between two consecutive values, then
            linear interpolation is used to calculate the result.</p>
