            <p>A <code>CorrelationAggregator</code> is an Aggregator that returns the degree of
            correlation between two numeric properties as a <code>Double</code>.  The returned
            number ranges from -1 (perfectly anti-correlated) to 0 (uncorrelated) to 1 (perfectly
            correlated).  The correlation is <code>NaN</code> if no values were found, or if the
            <a href="variance_pop.html">variance</a> of one of the properties found was zero.  This
            Aggregator overrides the <code>terminateDoubleDouble</code> method, so that the
            correlation is also available as a <a href="../dd/double_double.html">DoubleDouble</a>.
            This allows the correlation to be used by other Aggregators as a high-precision
            <code>DoubleDouble</code>.</p>

        <section id="usage" name="Usage">
            <p>Create and use a <code>CorrelationAggregator</code>, with one of the following
            methods:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>Aggregator agg = new CorrelationAggregator("propertyOne", "propertyTwo");</code></li>
                <li><code>Aggregator agg = Aggregator.getAggregator("Correlation(propertyOne, propertyTwo)");</code></li>
            </ul>
            <p>The values returned by the two properties of the object must be numeric.</p>
            <p>The correlation is calculated by determining the
            <a href="covariance_pop.html">population covariance</a> of the two properties, and
            dividing it by the square root of the product of the
            <a href="variance_pop.html">population variances</a> of each of the two properties.</p>
