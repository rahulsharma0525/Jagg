            <p>A <code>VarianceAggregator</code> is an Aggregator that returns the sample variance
            of a numeric property as a <code>Double</code>.  The sample variance is
            <code>NaN</code> if no values were found, and it is zero if exactly one value was
            found.  This Aggregator overrides the <code>terminateDoubleDouble</code> method, so
            that the sample variance is also available as a
            <a href="../dd/double_double.html">DoubleDouble</a>.  This allows the sample variance
            to be used by other Aggregators as a high-precision <code>DoubleDouble</code>.</p>

        <section id="usage" name="Usage">
            <p>Create and use a <code>VarianceAggregator</code>, with one of the following
            methods:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>Aggregator agg = new VarianceAggregator("property");</code></li>
                <li><code>Aggregator agg = Aggregator.getAggregator("Variance(property)");</code></li>
            </ul>
            <p>The values returned by the property of the object must be numeric.</p>
            <p>The sample variance is calculated by summing up the squares of the values'
            differences from their arithmetic mean (average), then dividing that sum
            by (<em>n</em> - 1), where <em>n</em> is the number of non-null occurrences.</p>
