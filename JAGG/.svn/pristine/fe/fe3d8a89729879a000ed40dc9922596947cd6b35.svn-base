            <p>A <code>ProductAggregator</code> is an Aggregator that calculates the product of
            numeric values, returning the product as a <code>Double</code>.  If no values were
            encountered, then the returned value is 1.  This Aggregator overrides the
            <code>terminateDoubleDouble</code> method, so that the product is also available as a
            <a href="../dd/double_double.html">DoubleDouble</a>.  This allows the product to be
            used by other Aggregators as a high-precision <code>DoubleDouble</code>.</p>

            <p>Create and use an <code>ProductAggregator</code>, with one of the following methods:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>Aggregator agg = new ProductAggregator("property");</code></li>
                <li><code>Aggregator agg = Aggregator.getAggregator("Product(property)");</code></li>
            </ul>
            <p>The values returned by the property of the object must be numeric.</p>
            <p>The product is calculated by multiplying together all encountered values.</p>
