            <p>A <code>MinAggregator</code> is an Aggregator that determines and returns the
            minimum of the property values.  If no values were encountered, then the minimum is
            <code>null</code>.  This Aggregator does not use floating-point calculations, so it
            does not override the <code>terminateDoubleDouble</code> method.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="usage" name="Usage">
            <p>Create and use a <code>MinAggregator</code>, with one of the following methods:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>Aggregator agg = new MinAggregator("property");</code></li>
                <li><code>Aggregator agg = Aggregator.getAggregator("Min(property)");</code></li>
            </ul>
            <p>The values returned by the property of the object must be <code>Comparable</code>.
            This includes, but is not limited to, all numeric values and Strings.</p>
            <p>The value's "compareTo" method may be called to establish which object is the
            minimum.</p>
