            <p>A <code>ModeAggregator</code> is an Aggregator that determines and returns the
            mode of the property values, i.e. the value that occurs most often.  If no values were
            encountered, then the mode is <code>null</code>.  If multiple modes were found, that
            is, one value occurred as frequently as another value, then the first mode is used.
            This Aggregator does not use floating-point calculations, so it does not override the
            <code>terminateDoubleDouble</code> method.</p>

        <section id="usage" name="Usage">
            <p>Create and use a <code>ModeAggregator</code>, with one of the following methods:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>Aggregator agg = new ModeAggregator("property");</code></li>
                <li><code>Aggregator agg = Aggregator.getAggregator("Mode(property)");</code></li>
            </ul>
            <p>The values returned by the property of the object must be <code>Comparable</code>.
            This includes, but is not limited to, all numeric values and Strings.</p>
            <p>The value's "compareTo" method may be called to establish the order of all object
            values.</p>
