            <p>A <code>SumAggregator</code> is an Aggregator that calculates the sum of numeric
            values, returning the sum as a <code>Double</code>.  If no values were encountered,
            then the returned sum is zero.  This Aggregator overrides the
            <code>terminateDoubleDouble</code> method, so that the sum is also available as a
            <a href="../dd/double_double.html">DoubleDouble</a>.  This allows the sum to be used by
            other Aggregators as a high-precision <code>DoubleDouble</code>.</p>

        <section id="usage" name="Usage">
            <p>Create and use a <code>SumAggregator</code>, with one of the following methods:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>Aggregator agg = new SumAggregator("property");</code></li>
                <li><code>Aggregator agg = Aggregator.getAggregator("Sum(property)");</code></li>
            </ul>
            <p>The values returned by the property of the object must be numeric.</p>
            <p>The sum is calculated as expected, by adding all values together.</p>
