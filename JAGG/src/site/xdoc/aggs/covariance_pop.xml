            <p>A <code>CovariancePopAggregator</code> is an Aggregator that returns the population
            covariance of two numeric properties as a <code>Double</code>.  The population
            covariance is <code>NaN</code> if no non-null pairs of values were found, and it is
            zero if exactly one pair of non-null values was found.  This Aggregator overrides the
            <code>terminateDoubleDouble</code> method, so that the population covariance is also
            available as a <a href="../dd/double_double.html">DoubleDouble</a>.  This allows the
            population covariance to be used by other Aggregators as a high-precision
            <code>DoubleDouble</code>.</p>

        <section id="usage" name="Usage">
            <p>Create and use a <code>CovariancePopAggregator</code>, with one of the following
            methods:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>Aggregator agg = new CovariancePopAggregator("propertyOne", "propertyTwo");</code></li>
                <li><code>Aggregator agg = Aggregator.getAggregator("CovariancePop(propertyOne, propertyTwo)");</code></li>
            </ul>
            <p>The values returned by the two properties of the object must be numeric.</p>
            <p>The population covariance is calculated by summing up the products of both values'
            differences from their respective arithmetic means (averages), then dividing that sum
            by (<em>n</em>), where <em>n</em> is the number of occurrences where both
            properties are not <code>null</code>.</p>
