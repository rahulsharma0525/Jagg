            <p>A <code>CollectAggregator</code> is an Aggregator that extracts the property values
            and adds them to a <code>List</code>, which is returned when finished.  If no values
            were encountered, then the returned list is empty.  This Aggregator does not use
            floating-point calculations, so it does not override the
            <code>terminateDoubleDouble</code> method.</p>

        <section id="usage" name="Usage">
            <p>Create and use a <code>CollectAggregator</code>, with one of the following methods:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>Aggregator agg = new CollectAggregator("property");</code></li>
                <li><code>Aggregator agg = Aggregator.getAggregator("Collect(property)");</code></li>
            </ul>
            <p>There is no restriction on the type of property values expected.</p>
            <p>The list is built by adding the property values in the order in which jAgg finds
            them in the original list of values.</p>
