            <p>An <code>AvgAggregator</code> is an Aggregator that calculates the average of
            numeric values, returning the average as a <code>Double</code>.  If no values were
            encountered, then the returned average is <code>Double.NaN</code>.  This Aggregator
            overrides the <code>terminateDoubleDouble</code> method, so that the average is also
            available as a <a href="../dd/double_double.html">DoubleDouble</a>.  This allows the
            average to be used by other Aggregators as a high-precision <code>DoubleDouble</code>.</p>

        <section id="usage" name="Usage">
            <p>Create and use an <code>AvgAggregator</code>, with one of the following methods:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>Aggregator agg = new AvgAggregator("property");</code></li>
                <li><code>Aggregator agg = Aggregator.getAggregator("Avg(property)");</code></li>
            </ul>
            <p>The values returned by the property of the object must be numeric.</p>
            <p>The average is calculated as expected for the arithmetic mean, which is the sum of
            all values divided by the count of all values.</p>
