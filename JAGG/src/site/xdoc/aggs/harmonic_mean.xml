            <p>A <code>HarmonicMeanAggregator</code> is an Aggregator that calculates the
            harmonic mean of numeric values, returning the harmonic mean as a
            <code>Double</code>.  If no values were encountered, then the returned harmonic mean
            is <code>Double.NaN</code>.  If any encountered value is zero, then the harmonic mean
            is <code>Double.NaN</code>.  If the sum of all values is zero, then the harmonic mean
            is <code>Double.NaN</code>.  This Aggregator overrides the
            <code>terminateDoubleDouble</code> method, so that the harmonic mean is also available
            as a <a href="../dd/double_double.html">DoubleDouble</a>.  This allows the harmonic
            mean to be used by other Aggregators as a high-precision <code>DoubleDouble</code>.</p>

        <section id="usage" name="Usage">
            <p>Create and use a <code>HarmonicMeanAggregator</code>, with one of the following methods:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>Aggregator agg = new HarmonicMeanAggregator("property");</code></li>
                <li><code>Aggregator agg = Aggregator.getAggregator("HarmonicMean(property)");</code></li>
            </ul>
            <p>The values returned by the property of the object must be numeric.</p>
            <p>The harmonic mean is calculated by dividing <em>n</em> by the sum of all values,
            where <em>n</em> is the number of values.</p>
